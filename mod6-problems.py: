#1. Given a list of numbers, write code to iterate through the list and calculate the sum of all even numbers. Print the resulting sum.
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
print("Sum of even numbers:", sum(num for num in numbers if num % 2 == 0))

#2. With a list of strings provided, write code that counts how many times the word "Olympic" appears in the list, and then print the count.
strings = ["Olympic", "Games", "Olympic", "Champion", "Olympic", "Medal"]
print("Count of 'Olympic':", strings.count("Olympic"))

#3. Given a list of strings, write code to create a new list that includes only the strings longer than three characters. Print the resulting filtered list.
string_list = ["cat", "dog", "elephant", "fox", "a", "an", "tree"]
print("Filtered list:", [s for s in string_list if len(s) > 3])

#4. For a list of integers, write code that counts how many numbers are positive and how many are negative, then print both counts.
integers = [-5, 3, -1, 7, -2, 8, 0, -9]
print("Positive count:", sum(num > 0 for num in integers))
print("Negative count:", sum(num < 0 for num in integers))

#5. For a list of integers, use a loop to build a new list where each element is the square of the corresponding element in the original list. Print the new list.
original_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
print("Squared list:", [num ** 2 for num in original_list])
