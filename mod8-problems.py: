#1. Create a file called gardening_tips.txt and add at least 3 gardening tips to it. Write a Python script that reads a file gardening_tips.txt and prints out each tip one by one.
def read_gardening_tips(file_path):
    with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
        tips = file.readlines()
        for tip in tips:
            print(tip.strip())

read_gardening_tips('gardening_tips.txt')

#2. Write a Python program that allows users to log their hiking trips.
def log_hiking_trips():
    with open('hiking_log.txt', 'a') as file:
        while True:
            hike_name = input("Enter hike name (or 0 to exit): ")
            if hike_name == '0':
                break
            distance = input("Enter distance in miles: ")
            file.write(f"{hike_name} - {distance} miles\n")
    
    with open('hiking_log.txt', 'r') as file:
        print("\nHiking Log Contents:")
        print(file.read())

log_hiking_trips()

#3. Create a text file called song_lyrics.txt and copy the lyrics of a song into it.
def count_word_frequency():
    with open('song_lyrics.txt', 'r') as file:
        lyrics = file.read().lower()  
    
    word_count = {}
    for _ in range(5):
        word = input("Enter a word to count: ").lower()
        word_count[word] = lyrics.split().count(word)
    
    print("\nWord Frequency Count:")
    print(word_count)

count_word_frequency()

#4. Create a poll.txt file that contains a list of "yea" or "nay" votes separated by commas.
def count_votes():
    with open('poll.txt', 'r') as file:
        votes = file.read().strip().split(',')  
    
    yea_count = votes.count('yea')
    nay_count = votes.count('nay')
    
    print(f"Yea votes: {yea_count}")
    print(f"Nay votes: {nay_count}")

count_votes()
