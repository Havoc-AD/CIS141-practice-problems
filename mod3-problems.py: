# 1. Prompt the user for a word. Then, prompt the user for how many times they'd like that word repeated. Use the skills you learned in this module to print the word the correct number of times.
word = input("Enter a word: ")
repeat_count = int(input("How many times would you like the word repeated? "))
print((word + " ") * repeat_count)

#2. Prompt the user for their name and their age. Calculate their age next year. Use string concatenation to print "Hello, <name>! You are <age1> years old. Next year, you will be <age2> years old."
name = input("Enter your name: ")
age = int(input("Enter your age: "))
print(f"Hello, {name}! You are {age} years old. Next year, you will be {age + 1} years old.")

#3. Prompt the user for a sentence and a word to try to find in that sentence. Have the program print out whether the word was found in the sentence. (i.e. True or False)
sentence = input("Enter a sentence: ")
word = input("Enter a word to find: ")
print(word in sentence)

#4. Prompt the user for: a word, a first index, and a last index. Slice the word at the indexes provided by the user and print to the screen.
word = input("Enter a word: ")
start = int(input("Start index: "))
end = int(input("End index: "))
print(word[start:end])

#5. Print 3 words with a | character (called a pipe) in between them. Use the appropriate keyword argument in print() to do so.
print("Xbox", "Playstation", "PC", sep=" - ")
