#1. Prompt the user for a positive integer n. Use a while loop to sum all the integers from 1 up to n. Print the final sum.
n = int(input("Enter a positive integer: "))

sum_numbers = 0
i = 1

while i <= n:
    sum_numbers += i
    i += 1

print(sum_numbers)

#2. Define a string variable (e.g., my_string = "Olympic College"). Use a for loop to print each character on its own line. Convert each character to uppercase before printing.
my_string = "Can they cure diabetes?"

for char in my_string:
    print(char.upper())

#3. Use a for loop and the range() function to print all even numbers from 2 to 20.
for num in range(2, 21, 2):
    print(num)

#4. Use nested for loops to create a simple multiplication table for numbers 1 through 5. Format your output so that each row corresponds to multiplying by a specific number. Example output:
for i in range(1, 6):
    for j in range(1, 6):
        print(i * j, end="\t")
    print()

#5. Write a program that continuously asks the user to input a number. If the user enters 0, immediately stop asking for more numbers. Otherwise, print the number they entered. Sample interaction:
while (num := int(input("Enter a number (0 to stop): "))):
    print(num)
